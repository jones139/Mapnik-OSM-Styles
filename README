Mapnik_OSM_Styles README
========================

Mapnik_OSM_Styles is a collection of mapnik stylesheets and utilities I have 
used for generating maps from OpenStreetMap Data.

They generally use the carto styling language, rather than generating mapnik
xml directly, as this produces clearer styles for ease of maintenance.

I am still learning, so would appreciate any comments on how to do this
more elegantly!

Have a look at the README in the three_villages_map directory to get started.

The directories in this repository are:
contours - scripts to create contour lines in a postgresql database, based
on SRTM data, so they can be plotted on a map.

keffalonia_map - a simple rendering of a map with contours and tourist points 
	       of interest that I developed for our holidays in kefalonia.

three_villages_map - simple rendering with contours and hiking routes
		   highlighted.

test_case - tests!
