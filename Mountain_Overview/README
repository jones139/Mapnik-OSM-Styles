three_villages_map
==================

About
-----
This directory contains the map style I used for creating the 'Three Villages
Native Tree Walk' route map (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Three_Villages_Native_Tree_Walk).
The features of the style are:
  - It uses the carto 'css' style pre-processor, so you need carto installed
      as well as mapnik2.  
      Install mapnik 2 using:
      	      	  cd ~
		  svn co http://svn.mapnik.org/trunk mapnik2
		  cd mapnik2
		  ./configure
		  make
		  sudo make install
      I use the version of carto supplied with
      tilemill.   Download tilemill using:
      		  cd ~
      		  git cone https://github.com/mapbox/tilemill.git
		  cd tilemill
		  ./ndistro
		  ln -s ~/tilemill/bin/carto /usr/bin/carto
  - It uses the world_boundaries shapefiles for coastlines 
    (hard coded to /home/graham/OSM/data/mapdata/world_boundaries/
    	  processed_p.shp) in hartlepool.mml.
	  This can be downloaded from 
	       http://tile.openstreetmap.org/processed_p.tar.bz2.
  - It includes contour lines based on srtm data, which is imported into
       the postgresql database.  Download the appropriate data tile from
       http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3.
       Import it into the database by running ./import_srtm.sh.
  - All hiking routes are rendered the same - if you want to use this to
       identify a particular one, you will have to add a filter on the osm_id
       (use the negative of the relation id of the route you want to render.
  - The map is rendered by executing ./make_map_cartoStyle.py.  This converts
       the carto styles (.mml and .mss) int a mapnik xml style file, and
       renders it.
